              <p>My name is Thad Donaghue. I am currently a full-time student at Epicodus in Portland. My ultimate dream is to land a job as a software engineer and start a new career in coding. I am very passionate about coding and look forward to alot of trial and error involved in becoming the best coder I can possibly be. I have worked several years doing inside sales for the printed circuit board and machined parts industry, but have recently decided that a career change is needed. Sales is a very stressful career and not something I enjoy doing for work.</p>
              <p>My number one passion in life is coding. I love coding for many reasons, but for one, it is the challenge and gratification that stems from solving complex problems and working on complicated projects. It allows for me to use my creativity and problem solving skills to generate a unique solution for each problem that I come across. It allows me to dive into deep and informative coding books and online tutorials to find new and exciting concepts and tricks for solving new challenges. Every day is another period of learning and improving your coding abilities. There is no greater feeling than when you figure out a new trick or discover a new concept for making your program work. Since coding is a technical field, growth is a constant. The field is constantly growing and new technologies are constantly being introduced which means you are never done learning. This is another thing I love so much about this industry and this field. Never worry about getting bored, there is always something new to try, fail at, learn from, and adapt to.</p>
              <p>My desire for a career change met reality in the Spring of 2018 when I learned of Epicodus. Epicodus is a coding bootcamp that teaches you how to learn coding. In my brief time here at Epicodus, I have already learned so much and have already put to use many of the lessons they have provided already. The pair programming and peer collaboration is such a powerful tool and I know this will be just the start to my highly successful career in software engineering!</p>
